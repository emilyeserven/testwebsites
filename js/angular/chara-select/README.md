What I'm aiming to do: [Prototype](https://xd.adobe.com/view/3b08ed02-f5b2-466a-bac0-36a73406dca3/screen/6adad8e9-9bc5-4838-9b7d-ec73c0b0e083/Home-Page)

(The page takes a little time to load. Only the "Emily" and "Sergio" boxes are clickable right now. The prototype shifts screens, but the box is supposed to be a modal popup.)
