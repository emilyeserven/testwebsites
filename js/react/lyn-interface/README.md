Sort of forked-copied from [this repository](https://github.com/planetoftheweb/reactinterface/).

## Using Components

* Imported `react` and `react-dom`
* Added a component that uses JSX
* Rendered out component and added the div with the corresponding ID to the `index.html`

## Working with State

* Added a `state` to the `MainInterface` component and added an expression in the `render`'s `return` function to show it
* Used a ternary operator in the context of showing state (and then promptly erased it)
* Used a variable as an expression value

The ternary operator was deleted during the tutorial, here it is for example's sake:

```js
{this.state.show ? 'Pet': null}
```
