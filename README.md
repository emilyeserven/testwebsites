# About this Repository
Any of my non-WordPress experimental websites will get thrown into this repo. Feel free to critique and nitpick in the Issues, the whole purpose of this is to document my learning and discover more. :)

### Box Project
An assignment from my [web design class](https://dmd1070.com/lessons/box-project.html). I used my Gigabyte Z97MX motherboard box as a basis for the project, so I had a chance to try out more non-traditional web design techniques.

This project was based off a [foundation](https://github.com/DMD1070/project-template) provided by the professor.

### Typography
Practice pages for my [web design class](https://dmd1070.com/lessons/7-web-typography.html#activity-type-setting-an-article) (Lesson 7). I attempted to put match fonts and visually appealing styling.

### Ornette
A practice website for my [web design class](https://dmd1070.com/) (Lesson 6), I challenged myself to write CSS without modifying any of the [original HTML](https://rawgit.com/emilyeserven/testwebsites/master/ornette/original/index.html).

### Rock, Paper, Scissors

Inspired by an exercise from the Codecademy JavaScript track. Expanded to include event listeners, more functions, and DOM manipulation.
