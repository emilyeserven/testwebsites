# About this Repository
Any of my non-WordPress experimental websites will get thrown into this repo. Feel free to critique and nitpick in the Issues, the whole purpose of this is to document my learning and discover more. :)

## Static

### Box Project
An assignment from my [web design class](https://dmd1070.com/lessons/box-project.html). I used my Gigabyte Z97MX motherboard box as a basis for the project, so I had a chance to try out more non-traditional web design techniques.

This project was based off a [foundation](https://github.com/DMD1070/project-template) provided by the professor.

### Typography
Practice pages for my [web design class](https://dmd1070.com/lessons/7-web-typography.html#activity-type-setting-an-article) (Lesson 7). I attempted to put match fonts and visually appealing styling.

### Ornette
A practice website for my [web design class](https://dmd1070.com/) (Lesson 6), I challenged myself to write CSS without modifying any of the [original HTML](https://rawgit.com/emilyeserven/testwebsites/master/ornette/original/index.html).

## JavaScript

### Rock, Paper, Scissors

Inspired by an exercise from the Codecademy JavaScript track. Expanded to include event listeners, more functions, and DOM manipulation.

### ThreeJS Tutorial

A light test/demo of the `three.js` library's tutorial. It's just a spinning cube. I will probably return to this later.

### The New Aesthetic Demo

A light test/demo of the `newaesthetic.js` library. Doesn't work using RawGit, so to see full effects, you'd need to locally serve it on your machine. (Alternatively, you can just peek at [this static preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emilyeserven/testwebsites/master/js/theNewAesthetic/itWorkedBefore.png).)

### A-Frame Demo

A demo of A Frame, a framework for WebVR. Not much has been done with this project yet.

### D3 Timeline Demo

A demo of D3 using a pre-existing timeline project. I switched the focus from philosophers to classic rock acts, because I've been listening to a lot of that music lately.

While I'm using code that was already written, I'd like to make some improvements. Some I am considering implementing:

* Logos in mouseover popup
* Multiple active years (in case of a hiatus and comeback)
* Custom colors per bar (to correspond with band themes)
* A different visual indicator for acts that are still active

### D3 Timeline Demo - Albums Version

A demo similar to the one above using one-off dates instead of ranges of dates. The data is all sourced from my personal music album collection (totaling 56 CDs at the time of this writing).

It'd be cool to do a matrix using D3 in the future, with the date the music was released on one axis and the relative "heaviness" of the music on another axis.

### API Test - Cooper Hewitt

A quick test to see if I could connect to an API I've never used before and interact with a page. while there aren't any specific interactive pieces to it yet, I consider the time it took to create to be a small personal victory.

Refactoring of this is definitely needed. Since the project was created on a limited-access school computer, I only worked with one HTML file and a ton of commits.

### Character Select Screen

An Angular practice website using pictures and bios of friends to fill out a "character selection" interface. Often would be seen in a video game.
