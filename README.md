# About this Repository
Any of my non-WordPress experimental websites will get thrown into this repo. Feel free to critique and nitpick in the Issues, the whole purpose of this is to document my learning and discover more. :)

## Static

### Box Project
An assignment from my [web design class](https://dmd1070.com/lessons/box-project.html). I used my Gigabyte Z97MX motherboard box as a basis for the project, so I had a chance to try out more non-traditional web design techniques.

This project was based off a [foundation](https://github.com/DMD1070/project-template) provided by the professor.

### Typography
Practice pages for my [web design class](https://dmd1070.com/lessons/7-web-typography.html#activity-type-setting-an-article) (Lesson 7). I attempted to put match fonts and visually appealing styling.

### Ornette
A practice website for my [web design class](https://dmd1070.com/) (Lesson 6), I challenged myself to write CSS without modifying any of the [original HTML](https://rawgit.com/emilyeserven/testwebsites/master/ornette/original/index.html).

## JavaScript

### Rock, Paper, Scissors

Inspired by an exercise from the Codecademy JavaScript track. Expanded to include event listeners, more functions, and DOM manipulation.

### ThreeJS Tutorial

A light test/demo of the `three.js` library's tutorial. It's just a spinning cube. I will probably return to this later.

### The New Aesthetic Demo

A light test/demo of the `newaesthetic.js` library. Doesn't work using RawGit, so to see full effects, you'd need to locally serve it on your machine. (Alternatively, you can just peek at [this static preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emilyeserven/testwebsites/master/js/theNewAesthetic/itWorkedBefore.png).)

A demo of A Frame, a framework for WebVR. Not much has been done with this project yet.

### Character Select Screen

An Angular practice website using pictures and bios of friends to fill out a "character selection" interface. Often would be seen in a video game.
