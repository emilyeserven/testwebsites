# About this Repository
Any of my non-WordPress experimental websites will get thrown into this repo. Feel free to critique and nitpick in the Issues, the whole purpose of this is to document my learning and discover more. :)

##Ornette
A practice website for my [web design class](https://dmd1070.com/) (Lesson 6), I challenged myself to write CSS without modifying any of the original HTML.
